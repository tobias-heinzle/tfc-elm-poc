Proof of concept implementation of the X-TFC method for a nonlinear PDE.
The method is implemented as outlined in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231221009140 and tested against a model problem proposed by the authors. For a more sophisticated and performant implementation by one of the authors of the original paper look at https://github.com/leakec/tfc.
